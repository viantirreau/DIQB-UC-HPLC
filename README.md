# DIQB-UC-HPLC
Read PDF files generated by HPLC instruments and reinterpret them as Excel .xlsx

Scripts written for an iPRE (Investigaci√≥n en Pregrado UC) program the author took part in second university year.
- Reads standard curves and fits sample areas to estimate their concentrations
- Generates plots for standard curves, as well as linear fit parameters
- Supports multiple molecule measurements and concentration reporting, as long as they are labeled accordingly

The script is written entirely in `Python 3.6` and its requirements are included in `requirements.txt` file
